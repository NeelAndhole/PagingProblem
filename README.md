# PagingProblem
This contains an asymptotically optimal implementation to the paging problem given we know all the future requests.
The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, the first line will be a positive integer, giving the number of pages in the cache. The second
line of the instance will be a positive integer giving the number of page requests. The third and final
line of each instance will be space delimited positive integers which will be the request sequence.
